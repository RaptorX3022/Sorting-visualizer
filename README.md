# Sorting-visualizer
A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts the elements of a list in a certain order. While there are a large number of sorting algorithms, in practical implementations a few algorithms predominate.In this implementation of sorting visualizer, you will be looking at some of these sorting algorithms and visually comprehend their working. The sorting algorithms covered here are Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort and Heap Sort. The list size is fixed to 130 elements.
Available Controls inside Sorting Visualizer:-

Use 0 to Generate a different randomized list.
Use 1 to start Selection Sort Algorithm.
Use 2 to start Insertion Sort Algorithm.
Use 3 to start Bubble Sort Algorithm.
Use 4 to start Merge Sort Algorithm.
Use 5 to start Quick Sort Algorithm.
Use 6 to start Heap Sort Algorithm.
Use q to exit out of Sorting Visualizer
